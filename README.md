## Updating firmware

To update firmware, just copy the update.upt file you have onto a properly formatted (exFAT) microSD card, insert the card into your powered off DAP, power it on, go to the Settings Menu, scroll to Firmware Update and then activate the Firmware Update function. It will take a minute or so and then the DAP will power off and then power on again with the new firmware installed.

It doesn't matter that you have any other files on the microSD card, I just use the same card that I keep music on.

The T6/Rocker "Firmware Update" function looks for whatever "update.upt" file that you have on the card to do the update. The "update.upt" file name is generic for ALL updates, be sure to have only the one you want to use on the card when you do the update.
